# Twitter Sentiment-Analysis


This repository contains my second SpringBoard Capstone Project.

## Summary: 
Building off the VADER sentiment analysis tools (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and applying it to tweets mined thru twitter API. After tweets about Kanye are gathered, and sentiment analysis will be performed on gathered data to analyse positivity/negativity over time, and corresponding to different public events. Other trends such as location, time of day, Iphone users vs android in sentiment, mobile vs pc, Length of tweet, etc will be considered. I would like to see what factors contribute to public sentiment, in this case on Kanye West.
